FoOlSlide 2
=========
__WARNING! THIS IS UNOFFICIAL!__

__Current working version: 2.8.19 "Early Christmas"__

FoOlSlide is a ridiculously elaborated comic reader meant for users to enjoy reading.
Sick of waiting for the official FoolSlide2? Check out this "Version 2". The update primarily focuses on bringing the design/libraries up to date and making FoOlSlide mobile-friendly. The backend theme has been updated to Bootstrap 3 (lots of code mods) and the frontend has been improved. Feel free to make your own theme.
Work on this project is not finished yet! Please report bugs and suggestions. The updater does not work yet either, so each new version needs to be downloaded manually. If upgrading from the original FoOlSlide, a full wipe is recommended. If you don't wanna do this, you can try and delete removed folders from /assets etc. It's not that hard
